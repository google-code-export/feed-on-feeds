#summary What you should know about the code on the trunk

= Introduction =

The code checked into the trunk right now is alpha quality.  When I think it's stable enough, I'll make a formal release called "Feed on Feeds 0.5".  For now I guess we can call it "Feed on Feeds 0.4999..."

= What seems to work =

This version has been fairly well tested on Firefox 1.5 and Safari 2.0.  It is installed on a Linux host with PHP 5.1 and MySQL 5.0.  PHP 4-ish and MySQL 3-ish may also be fine.  On my server I have two users, one (me!) with about 200 subscribed feeds and another with just a handful.  Performance is acceptable.

= What likely doesn't =

I have made some effort to get IE 6 to work but don't test regularly.

Feed on Feeds now has its own authentication built in, but I don't trust it yet and have my whole installation behind Apache authentication as well, and I suggest you do the same for the time being.

= What is definitely broken =

== Security ==

Code is probably rife with SQL injection attacks.

== Wii ==

I can't read my feeds very well on the Wii browser!  This must be fixed!  It would be nice if FoF had a workaround for the Wii browser's lack of tabs, as well.

= What is half done =

There is a basic implemenatiton of tagging, but it's nearly useless as is.  What would help is a way to tag a feed, or auto-tag items as they come in based on keywords or based on an outside tag source like del.icio.us.

Favicons can be turned on in the prefs, but sometimes SimplePie (the RSS/Atom engine) thinks a feed has one when it really doesn't, which then slows down page loading considerably.

Keyboard navigation.

Time zone stuff is halfway transitioned from being configured in a file to in the database.
