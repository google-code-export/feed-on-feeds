#summary How to recover if you've lost or forgotten your admin password
#labels Featured

You're going to need to get access your your database directly, either by command line, or through something like phpMyAdmin.  Just use this SQL statement to overwrite the user_password_hash for the admin account (user id 1) with this magic value:

`UPDATE fof_user SET user_password_hash = '21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3' WHERE user_id = 1`

Now you can log in with no password, and change it to something you will hopefully remember this time.
